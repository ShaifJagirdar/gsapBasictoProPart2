# GSAP ScrollTrigger Animation Project
This project showcases the usage of GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin to create scroll-based animations. The animations are triggered as the user scrolls through various sections of the webpage, making the experience interactive and visually engaging.

Features
Scroll-Based Animations: Animations triggered based on the user's scroll position.
Pinning and Scrubbing: Elements stay fixed during scroll and animate smoothly.
Dynamic Transitions: Rotation, resizing, and color transformations tied to scroll triggers.
Responsive Design: Ensures smooth animations across different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
HTML: Page structure with multiple sections.
CSS: Styling for layout and visual aesthetics.
JavaScript: GSAP animations and ScrollTrigger for scroll-based interactivity.
GSAP CDN: Includes both core GSAP and ScrollTrigger plugin.
Getting Started
